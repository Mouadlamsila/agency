# Walkthrough: Brand Identity Deep-Scan

I have completed a comprehensive analysis of the agency project's codebase to extract its core brand identity. The goal was to provide a structured reference for building a consistent personal brand on social media.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Visual DNA Extraction
By analyzing [globals.css](file:///c:/Users/devmo/Documents/projects/agency/src/app/globals.css) and the Tailwind configuration, I identified the primary color palette and typography that give the project its premium, high-tech look.
- **Primary Colors:** Brand Dark (`#0A0A0A`), Brand Blue (`#2E5CFF`), and Brand Violet (`#7B2EFF`).
- **Typography:** `Space Grotesk` (Technical/Modern) and `Geist Mono` (Meta/Data).
- **UI Style:** Glassmorphism with sharp, engineered details.

### 2. Copywriting & Tone Analysis
I scanned the localization files ([common.json](file:///c:/Users/devmo/Documents/projects/agency/src/locales/en/common.json)) and landing page components to understand the "Service Voice."
- **Value Proposition:** "We build the systems that power digital ambition."
- **Tone:** Technical, authoritative, and precise.
- **Power Words:** *Engineered, Scalable, Architecture, Systems, Logic.*

### 3. Service Hierarchy
I mapped the services based on their order of appearance and importance in the UI:
1. Web Engineering
2. SaaS Infrastructure
3. UI/UX Architecture
4. Enterprise Solutions
5. Technical Strategy

### 4. Social Media Asset Guide
I translated the technical UI patterns (like the "scan" animation and glass panels) into actionable design tips for Carousels and Reels.

## Final Report
The detailed guidelines are available in the [brand_guidelines.md](file:///C:/Users/devmo/.gemini/antigravity/brain/0a1c718c-5859-48c2-af4e-821a220a971b/brand_guidelines.md) artifact.
